## üìã Executive Summary
:**

Aspirin provides cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention benefits through its antiplatelet effects. It inhibits platelet aggregation and reduces thrombus formation via irreversible acetylation of COX-1 in platelets, thereby preventing some clotting factors from forming.

However, Aspirin also carries risks, notably an increased risk of major bleeding events, including gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral hemorrhage).

## üìä Detailed Analysis

### üöÄ Key Developments and Recent Advances
Recent research demonstrates aspirin's continued effectiveness in cardiovascular prevention with ongoing studies comparing dosage regimens and identifying optimal patient populations for both primary and secondary prevention.

### üìä Clinical Data and Trial Results
The USPSTF recommends individualizing low-dose aspirin therapy for primary prevention only in adults aged 40-59 years with a high CVD risk (10% or greater over the next decade), acknowledging that its benefits may not outweigh the risks elsewhere.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Treatment Mechanisms and Approaches
:**

Aspirin provides cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention benefits through its antiplatelet effects.

### üë• Patient Eligibility and Selection Criteria
Aspirin therapy is recommended for individuals with established cardiovascular disease for secondary prevention, with careful risk-benefit assessment required for primary prevention based on bleeding risk and cardiovascular risk factors.

### üîÆ Future Implications and Recommendations
Current evidence supports personalized aspirin dosing strategies, with emphasis on lower effective doses to minimize bleeding complications while maintaining cardiovascular protection, particularly important for long-term therapy adherence.
