## 📋 Executive Summary
Treatment for Stage 4 bone cancer prioritizes palliative care to enhance quality of life by managing pain, reducing tumor size, and preventing complications from metastasis or local invasion. While curative intent is rare at this stage due to widespread disease, surgery may still be considered in specific cases where accessible tumors can alleviate symptoms.

Treatment options for Stage 4 bone cancer are highly individualized, depending on the cancer type (subtype), location, extent of metastasis, and patient factors like overall health.
