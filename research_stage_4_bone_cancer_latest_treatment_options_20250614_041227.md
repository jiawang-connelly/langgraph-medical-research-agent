## üìã Executive Summary
Osteosarcoma (OS) and Ewing sarcoma are among the three most common primary bone cancers in pediatric populations, with OS accounting for approximately 2% of cases despite being more frequent overall compared to chondrosarcoma. These aggressive Stage 4 tumors often present with metastasis due to specific genetic mutations or predisposition syndromes.

Treatment for advanced osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma remains palliative but increasingly incorporates newer strategies such as targeted therapies designed to attack cancer cells based on their unique characteristics, including somatic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in Ewing sarcoma.
